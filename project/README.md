Semantic Search Project using Endee
Project Description

This project is a simple AI/ML application that demonstrates the use of Endee as a vector database. The goal of the project is to show how vector-based search can be used in a practical AI use case by storing and retrieving vector embeddings.
The project is developed as part of a project-based evaluation and is hosted on GitHub.

Use Case: Semantic Search
The implemented use case is Semantic Search.
In this project:

Text data is converted into vector embeddings
These vectors are stored in a vector database
A search query is also converted into a vector
Similar vectors are retrieved using vector similarity
This allows searching based on meaning (semantics) rather than exact keyword matching, which is the core idea of semantic search.

Vector Database
Endee is used as the vector database in this project.
Endee is responsible for storing vector embeddings
Endee is used to perform vector similarity search
The semantic search functionality is built on top of Endee’s vector search capability

Repository Information

This project is developed using a fork of the official Endee repository
The complete project code is hosted on GitHub as required
